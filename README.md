# Star Tracker
Batter is a clone of the classic breakout game.

## Getting Started
---
You will need: 
An equitorial telescope mount
Arduino Uno
2 Servo Motors
Joystick for arduino
Mount for Servos
External Power for arduino and servo
```
Arduino IDE
```
## Overview
Originally created as a star tracking telescope, however due to time constraints you control the servos manually. 
Using the arduino to rotate the servos (after converting them into continuous rotation servos)
This should rotate the dials of the telescope to position it.
Used zip ties for servo mounts.
Got shaft couplers to attach servos to dials.

## Required Technologies
---
* Python 3.8.0
